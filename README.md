## Application Improvements

If given the opportunity to improve on this application, these are some of the things I can suggest:

1. Add the functionality for the value of Pi to be reset to zero.

2. Use a more accurate algorithm to calculate the value of Pi.

3. Host this application on the cloud using Heroku (or something similar).
